splace
  Version 0.1

This program uses openssl to store your places encrypted. It is for experimental purposes.
This is a fork of the original "place" program.

usage:
        splace s                                Saves the current directory
        splace l                                Prints out the last saved directory
        splace p                                Pops the last saved directory (outputs and removes it)

        splace n x                      Prints the x'th stored place, from newest to oldest

                                        This is a super simple implementation of a lifo queue written
                                        in bash for you to store your places.

        splace --version                Shows place version.
        splace --help                   Shows this screen.
